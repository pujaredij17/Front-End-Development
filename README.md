General Description:

LEANEVENTO: LEAN is a nonprofit organization based in Spain. Its main purpose is to collect medicines to be sent to needed countries. In order to be able to send donated medicines, LEAN organizes events to collect money in order to ship the medicines. Your group has been selected to develop an App for LEAN to manage their events. LEAN Events can be free or paid. Free events are to collect money, to collect medicines or to collect cloth for poor people. Paid events are also to collect medicines, money or cloth but one needs to buy a ticket to participate or to go to the event. Tickets are sold by LEAN delegates or by other foundations or organizations. If any other organization is involved in the process, LEAN assigns a percentage of the ticket to that organization. Donations are used for tax purposes. LEANEVENTO will register anybody involved in any event whether is an individual or a foundation. If it is a foundation LEANEVENTO will register their corresponding percentage. Tickets can be bought from this APP using PAYPAL as a method of Payment.
